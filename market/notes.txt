Flask Forms
-Forms are an essential part of web applications, right from the user 
authentication interface to survey forms we require on our websites.
-When the user requests the page for the first time – he receives it via 
what we call a “GET method.”
-After filling the form, the user data is sent to the server via the POST method.
-These forms are displayed to the user through templates using the <form> 
attribute of HTML.
    GET/POST method for sending data.
-Each of these methods, also called HTTP methods, performs a specific action on 
the server resources. 
- Each method corresponds to a different task:
1.GET – This method pulls specific information form the webserver (just to view it)
2.POST – This method sends data from the user to the server.
ie Instagram .GET(allows you to see different content-posts and memes)
   POST(when you post a photo, you send information/data ie photo and caption to the instagram application server)
   Blog website. when you are reading a blog on the website, it is through the GET
   method. when you write and publish your blog, it is through the POST method. 


flask flash() method.
-its good practice to give the user feedback for his/her actions.
-The Flask flash method shows messages to the users.
-With Flash, we can create a flash message in one Flask View and then show
it in another View, called “next,” which usually is a template View.
-Hence, a Flask view creates a Flash message in one view and then passes it to 
the next view( along with the request), which displays the message to the user.
-The syntax for Flash:
     
     flash(message,category)

message: The message to display.
category: An Optional parameter, which can be set to “error,” “info,” or “warning.”

-To extract the flash message from the session, where it is stored, 
and display it on the template, we use the get_flashed_messages() function.
    
    get_flashed_messages(with_categories, category_filter)

with_categories: An Optional Parameter tuple to mention the category(error/info/warning)
category_filter: An Optional Parameter to filter and display only specific messages
